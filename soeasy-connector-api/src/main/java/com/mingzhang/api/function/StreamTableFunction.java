/**
 * Base class for a user-defined table function (UDTF) in Stream. A user-defined table functions works on zero, one, or
 * multiple scalar values as input and returns multiple rows as output.
 *
 * <p>
 * The behavior of a [[StreamTableFunction]] can be defined by implementing a custom evaluation method. An evaluation
 * method must be declared publicly, not static and named "eval". Evaluation methods can also be overloaded by
 * implementing multiple methods named "eval".
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * User-defined functions must have a default constructor and must be instantiable during runtime.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class Split extends TableFunction&lt;String&gt; {
 *
 *     // implement an "eval" method with as many parameters as you want
 *     public void eval(String str) {
 *         for (String s : str.split(" ")) {
 *             collect(s); // use collect(...) to emit an output row
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     // you can overload the eval method here ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @tparam T The type of the output row
