/**
 * Base class for User-Defined Aggregates.
 *
 * <p>
 * The behavior of an [[StreamAggregateFunction]] can be defined by implementing a series of custom methods. An
 * [[StreamAggregateFunction]] needs at least three methods: - createAccumulator, - accumulate, and - getValue.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All these methods muse be declared publicly, not static and named exactly as the names mentioned above. The methods
 * createAccumulator and getValue are defined in the [[StreamAggregateFunction]] functions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class SimpleAverageAccum extends Tuple2&lt;Long, Integer&gt; {
 *     public long sum = 0;
 *     public int count = 0;
 * }
 *
 * public class SimpleAverage extends StreamAggregateFunction&lt;Long, SimpleAverageAccum&gt; {
 *     public SimpleAverageAccum createAccumulator() {
 *         return new SimpleAverageAccum();
 *     }
 *
 *     public Long getValue(SimpleAverageAccum accumulator) {
 *         if (accumulator.count == 0) {
 *             return null;
 *         } else {
 *             return accumulator.sum / accumulator.count;
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     // overloaded accumulate method
 *     public void accumulate(SimpleAverageAccum accumulator, long iValue) {
 *         accumulator.sum += iValue;
 *         accumulator.count += 1;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Overloaded accumulate method
 *     public void accumulate(SimpleAverageAccum accumulator, int iValue) {
 *         accumulator.sum += iValue;
 *         accumulator.count += 1;
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * @tparam T the type of the aggregation result
 * @tparam ACC base class for aggregate Accumulator. The accumulator is used to keep the aggregated values which are
 *         needed to compute an aggregation result. AggregateFunction represents its state using accumulator, thereby
 *         the state of the AggregateFunction must be put into the accumulator.
